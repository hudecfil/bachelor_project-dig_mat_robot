# Design and Construction of a Relative Robot for Manipulating Digital Materials

In my bachelor project I will be focusing on design and contruction of a relative builder robot, that manipulates with digital
materials. Digital materials come in variety of mechanical properties, which are picked to suit given purpose. For our purpose of building structures we will use discrete metamaterials subunits called VOXELs. Voxels are simply "cubes" formed of 6 faces - lattices.
Those lattices can have earlier mentioned various properties, for example they can be just rigid structures keeping its shape, or they can be able to squeeze in certain directions. Voxels that I'll be using are rigid, but equiped with magnetic joints, so they can be joined together just like LEGO bricks.

## Designing the voxels

First of all I have to design my voxels. I based it on design of simple rigid voxel. I added holes for magnets and edited corner brace - when robot docks on the voxel, lock. Whole design is made in Fusion 360. Each lattice is 3D printed from PETG. Specific print settings: sequential printing - printer finishes first one object and than moves to another; no infill - increased number of perimeters to 5; material - PETG;
temperatures (nozzle/heat-bed) - first lr.: 230째C/85째C, other lrs.: 240째C/90째C;  layer height - 0.15 mm.
